ui5-starter
===================================

Starter template for a Fiori-like UI5 application


### How to Use
Clone this starter template and serve the 'webapp' directory.

You will have to download the UI5 library and put it inside a folder named 'resources' inside the 'webapp' directory.

If you do not want to download a local copy of the resources, change the bootstrap code in the 'index.html' file in the 'webapp' directory to use the CDN.
